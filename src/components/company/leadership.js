          In 2012, our founders were working at a major ad tech company of the
          time.
        </h3>
        <h3>They identified a problem worth solving.</h3>
        <p>
          Ads were constrained — locked into fixed spaces that weren’t
          working. Meanwhile, Facebook and Google had cracked the code placing
          ads directly into the feed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their launch idea was to create better ads for the open web — to
          take what the platforms had done and bring it to everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          They soon realized that their technology would benefit 3 different
          constituencies: advertisers, publishers and consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They named the company TripleLift, because our solutions lift the
          fortunes of all three of these groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, the business has grown exponentially, as measured by
          products, geographies, employees and revenue.
